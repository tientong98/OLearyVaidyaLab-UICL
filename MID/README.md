Code for the behavioral data and fMRI data of the Monetary Incentive Delay task. 

The MID in this study was similar to the one used by Knutson and colleagues (2003). The MRI scan consisted of 3 MID runs that each lasted for 8 minutes and 16 seconds. Each run had 48 trials (24 gain trials, 24 loss trials), with 6 trials for each level of gain/loss (neutral, $0.20, $1.00, and $5.00). Within a trial, a cue signifying the valence (gain or loss) and level appeared for 250 ms, followed by a delay period during which participants looked at a fixation cross (Delay 1 Duration: 2000-2500ms). The target (a white square) would then appear (Target Duration: 160-260ms) and participants were asked to respond quickly by pressing a button. Afterward, there was another delay (Delay 2 Duration = 4000ms – Delay 1 Duration – Target Duration). At the end of each trial, participants received visual feedback on their performance (1750 ms). All participants completed some practice trials in a mock scanner prior to the task. Similar to Knutson and colleagues (2003), task difficulty was calibrated for each participant based on the practice performance so that the success rate would be approximately 66% on average. As an incentive, participants won the average amount of money they earned in addition to the participation compensation.
